# Deep-Learning-Applications-with-GUI

List of FOSS Deep Learning (Desktop) Applications with GUI and/or CLI. Most Deep Learning models require a complicated setup and are not ready to use out of the box. At best there is a Colab or Jupiter notebook available, which is good for testing, but not for production use.

The software in this list is ready to use (CLI or GUI).
